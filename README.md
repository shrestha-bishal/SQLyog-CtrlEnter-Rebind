This is a small AutoHotkey-based utility that remaps Ctrl + Enter to execute the current query in SQLyog, on top of the default F9 key behaviour. It mimics the behaviour of query execution in tools like MySQL Workbench, improving workflow consistency across environments.

#### Features
- Automatically detects active SQLyog window.
- Selects and executes the current query line with Ctrl + Enter.

- Open SQLyog and place the cursor on a SQL line.
- Press Ctrl+Enter to execute the current line.
